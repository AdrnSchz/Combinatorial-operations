Once the program is runned. A menu with 4 options is showed. One option for each set of dataset sizes the program has.

After selecting 1 another menu with the 2 problems will be shown: 1 high speed sailing, 2 Full fleet

Finally, after selecting the one of the 2, two more options will be shown: 
		1 backtracking ,2 branch and bound if you selected high speed sailing
		
		1 backtracking, 2 greedy if you selected full fleet.


After selecting one method the program will execute them and after finishing the time took during the execution, the best config and the best solution will be shown. 

The only exception is branch and bound. As it works a little strange for datasets with 13 or 14 sailors. So in the case of branc and bound once selected. It will rpint each new best solution found.
